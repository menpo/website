We provide detailed guides for installing Menpo on each of the 3 major operating
systems. Menpo is designed to provide a suite of tools to solve a complex
problem and therefore has a complex set of dependencies. In order to make
things as simple as possible for new Python developers, we advocate the use
of [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/). Therefore, our installation instructions
focus on getting Conda installed on each of the platforms.

**Before we begin, please choose an operating system:**

  - [Windows]({filename}/pages/installation/windows/landing.md)
  - [OS X]({filename}/pages/installation/osx/landing.md)
  - [Linux]({filename}/pages/installation/linux/landing.md)
