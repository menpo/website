Title: Linux Installation

For Linux platforms, we only fully support **Ubuntu 14.04** as this is the
platform used most commonly by the Menpo developers. However, we believe that
the general set of instructions should be broadly applicable to most Linux
based platforms.

If you run a different flavour of Linux and come across any errors, please
raise an issue on our [Github Issues](https://github.com/menpo/menpo/issues)
page.

Although Ubuntu ships with a Python installation, it is generally regarded as
dangerous to alter this environment. Therefore, to maintain consistency and to
isolate the default Python environment, we advocate the use of
[Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/).
