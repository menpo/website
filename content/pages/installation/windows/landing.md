On Windows, we only provide one set of installation instructions. We assume you
are going to use [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) in order
to provide a Python installation. If you are an advanced Windows users that
uses a different Python ecosystem, we are happy to hear from you on the
[menpo-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/menpo-users) mailing list
so that we can extend these instructions!

**Python assumes some basic knowledge of using a command prompt within
Windows.**
