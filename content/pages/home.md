Menpo is a statistical modelling toolkit, providing all the tools required to
build, fit, visualize, and test deformable models like
**Active Appearance Models**, **Constrained Local Models** and
**Supervised Descent Method**.

We aim to provide a **free** and **open source**
([BSD Licensed](https://github.com/menpo/menpo/blob/master/LICENSE.txt))
implementation of common deformable model paradigms. These techniques are
applicable to a broad class of objects and have been heavily researched for
use with faces.

Menpo is written in **Python** and we provide a simple and easy method of
installation using [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/). We suggest you head over
to the [installation instructions]({filename}/pages/installation/index.md)
to get started.

If you are looking for the code, you can find it on
[Github](https://github.com/menpo/menpo). Please contribute!
