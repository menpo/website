Menpo is a statistical modelling toolkit, providing all the tools required to
build, fit, visualize, and test deformable models like
**Active Appearance Models**, **Constrained Local Models**, **Supervised Descent
Method** and **Morphable Models**.

We aim to provide a **free** and **open source** (BSD Licensed) implementation
of common deformable model paradigms. These techniques are applicable to a
broad class of rigid objects and have been heavily researched for use with
faces.

Menpo is written in **Python** and we provide a simple and easy method of
installation using [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/). We suggest you head over
to the [installation instructions]({filename}/pages/installation/index.md)
to get started.
